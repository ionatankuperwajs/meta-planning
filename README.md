# meta-planning

**Implementation of the normative meta-planning model described in Kuperwajs, Ho, and Ma (2024).**

## Approach

This repository provides implementational details as well as simulations and analysis for a model of meta-planning using Jupyter notebooks. The code for a cognitive model of human play in 4-in-a-row referenced in the text is available at https://github.com/tseip/fourinarow. Cognitive model fits and predictions are also available upon request.
